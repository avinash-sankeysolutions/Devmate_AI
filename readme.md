## Overview

DevMate AIâ€‹ is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to help developers improve code performance by analyzing the time and space complexity of functions and providing AI-driven optimization suggestions. The extension supports `.js`, `.ts`, and `.jsx` files.

## Features

- **Time & Space Complexity Analysis**: Displays the time and space complexity for each function in supported files.
- **AI-Driven Code Optimization**: Provides actionable suggestions to improve function performance.
- **File Type Support**: Compatible with JavaScript (`.js`), TypeScript (`.ts`), and JSX (`.jsx`) files.
- **Seamless Integration**: Directly integrates with the Visual Studio Code interface, displaying results within the editor.

## How It Works

1. **Install the Extension**
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to the Extensions Marketplace and search for DevMateAI.
   - Click **Insatall**.

2. **Usage**
   - Open any `.js`, `.ts`, or `.jsx` file.
   - After every function, you'll see two options: **Analyze Complexity** and **Optimize with AI**.

3. **Analyze Complexity**
   - Click on **Analyze Complexity** to calculate and display the time and space complexity of the function.
   - The results will appear on the left side of the editor under the "API Response" section.

4. **Optimize with AI**
   - Click on **Optimize with AI** to get AI-driven optimization suggestions for the function.
   - The optimized code will appear in the "API Response" section.
