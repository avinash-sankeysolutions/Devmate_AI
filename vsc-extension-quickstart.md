Alternatively, you can install the extension manually:

1. Download the latest `.vsix` file from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/avinash-sankeysolutions/Devmate_AI/releases) page.
2. In Visual Studio Code, go to **Extensions** > **Install from VSIX...** and select the downloaded file.

### 2. Set Up Your Local Environment (Optional)

DevMate AI can also be run locally using **Ollama** with custom models. If you want to run the extension on your local machine:

1. **Download Ollama** from [Ollama's official site](https://ollama.com).
2. Choose your favorite model in Ollama.
3. Clone this repo and download the server file.
4. Make sure **Node.js** is installed on your machine.
5. Run the server locally using the provided files in the repository.

### 3. Analyze Your Code

Once installed:

1. Open a JavaScript (`.js`), TypeScript (`.ts`), or JSX (`.jsx`) file.
2. Select a function in your code.
3. You will see two options:
   - **Analyze Complexity**: Calculates and shows the time and space complexity of the selected function.
   - **Optimize with AI**: Provides AI-driven code optimization suggestions based on your code.

### 4. View Results

The complexity analysis and optimization suggestions will be displayed directly in the editor, under the "API Response" section on the left panel.
